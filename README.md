The user has been inserted into MySQL database:

Seems like I don't own any car at the moment.

Let's go and see which car I would like to buy!

And they are also inserted into MySQL:

Now, I think the Mercedes suits me the most:

After entering all my details, let's complete the transaction:

Wow!

Now let's see if my car collection list has been updated!

Looks like it's there! Let's also see if anything changed in MySQL database.

Seems like a new instance of the Mercedes was created and it belongs to the user in cause:
